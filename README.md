> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This repo was an experiment to check if data could be interchanged between DeSmuME and the host using its filesystem via savefiles.
> As far as I can remember, the project was not successful with this strategy. The code is not functional. 
> Even though, we tried another strategy: Instead of using savefiles, using a FAT mounted into DeSmuME. This was a success.
> You can find the code that implements the interchange of data between DeSmuME and host using a FAT image in [this](https://github.com/URV-teacher/filesystem-nds) repo.
> This repo will be archived.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/URV-teacher/hello-world-nds/.github/images/product-screenshot.png)

This repository contains the source code for creating a `.nds` executable that you can run in real or emulated hardware
of the Nintendo DS. 

This project has been created as a way to test compilation environments.

It also features a workflow that builds and releases the binary on every commit.

To know more about my projects as a teacher for University Rovira i Virgili, you can check the
[GitHub page](https://github.com/URV-teacher).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Install development environment 
###### Windows
You can install it manually by moving the `bmde` folder (not included) into `C:\URV\` and creating the corresponding 
environment variables.

Afterward, you can do the following to clone, compile and run the code:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/URV-teacher/bmde-linux
cd bmde-linux
make clean
make
make run
```

###### Multi-platform (Docker)
1. Install Docker in your system.
2. Clone the `bmde` repository: `git clone https://github.com/URV-teacher/bmde-linux`
3. Enter inside the `input` folder: `cd bmde-linux/input` and clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/URV-teacher/hello-world-nds`


### Compile software
###### Windows
1. Open a terminal in the root folder of the NDS project that you want to compile.
2. Execute `make`.
3. The `.nds` binary from the project should be in the root folder of the repository. 

###### Multi-platform (Docker)
1. Go back to the root folder of the repository `bmde`: `cd ..`
2. Run `docker compose up`
3. The `.nds` binary from the `hello-world-nds` project will be on the `output` folder.


### Run software
###### Windows
1. Download and install DeSmuME from [official page](https://desmume.org/download/). We target version `0.9.11-dev` that
   you can download from [here][desmume-download], but the binary also has been proved to work in later versions.
2. Run DeSmuME and open the `.nds` file.
3. You should see the "Hello world" message being displayed in the inferior screen of the NDS.

###### Multi-platform (Flatpak)
1. Download and install Flatpak `flatpak install flathub org.desmume.DeSmuME`
2. Run DeSmuMe Flatpak `flatpak run org.desmume.DeSmuME`
3. open the `.nds` file.
4. You should see the "Hello world" message being displayed in the inferior screen of the NDS.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
<!-- Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos 
work well in this space. You may also link to more resources. -->
## Usage
You can use this project as a basic compilation test tool for a NDS development environment. 

This project was used to test the
port of the `bmde` environment to Linux that is used in the subjects Computers, Computer Fundamentals and Operating 
System Structure
in the Universitat Rovira i Virgili.

###### Workflow
There is also a GitHub workflow that is triggered on every push to `master` branch to compile the project and release
it. You can download the `.nds` from [there](https://github.com/URV-teacher/hello-world-nds/releases/tag/v1.0) to try it
directly without compilation.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
This project is completely functional! But there is space for improvements...
- Refine Docker for usage with the port of the `bmde` environment to Linux.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/URV-teacher/hello-world-nds/issues) for a full list of proposed features
(and known issues).
